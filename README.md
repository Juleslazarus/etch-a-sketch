If you're reading this, thanks for checking my project out!

The code is a little crazy and it needs to be formatted but
This project was a great way for me to learn more about 
Functions and nesting functions inside even more functions 
As well as what an event listener can and can't do. 

I have many features left to add but as of 08/27/2022
This project is at a point where it's running pretty well.
